### General Overview
**Instruction:** Provide a short general overview of your target. What are its intended use-cases,
what type of features does it support, etc.

### Set-Up Debug Environment
**Instruction:** Set up a debug environment for your target. If you are targeting an embedded
device this might include setting up emulation, for windows targets you might need a
windows debugger, and in some cases you may want to play around with compile
flags to set up source code debugging if possible. Do what you can given your
target, describe what you did, and upload required files for this to your teamâ€™s github
repository.

### Map Out Target Code-Base
**Instruction:** Map out the targets code-base. Your target probably has many source directories
with various different files. In this part we want you to describe the general layout
and purpose of different files, major functions, etc. From this we should geta good
idea of where exactly in the target-code we should look to find specific features,
code-sections, etc.

### Plans for Rest of Project
**Instruction:** What are your plans for the rest of the project?
